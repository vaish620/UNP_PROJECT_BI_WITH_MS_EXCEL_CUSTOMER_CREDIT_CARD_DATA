# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA
As part of my MBA coursework, my team and I worked on an Excel-based data analysis project for MVPS Bank. We handled a large dataset, applying pivot tables, slicers, and dashboards to extract key insights. Our project focused on visualizing trends, customer spending behavior, and performance metrics effectively.
